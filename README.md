Market Basket Analysis is a data mining technique used to identify patterns and relationships between different items in a transactional dataset. It's commonly used in retail to analyze customer purchasing behavior and identify opportunities to increase sales.

Step 1: Prepare the Data
To perform Market Basket Analysis, you'll need a dataset containing transactional data, such as customer purchases. The dataset should have the following columns:
Transaction ID: a unique identifier for each transaction
Item ID: a unique identifier for each item purchased
Quantity: the number of items purchased in each transaction
You can use a sample dataset or create your own dataset.

Step 2: Preprocess the Data
Preprocess the data by:
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., item IDs)
Normalizing the data (e.g., scaling quantities)
You can use Python libraries like Pandas for data preprocessing.

Step 3: Implement Market Basket Analysis
Implement Market Basket Analysis using a Python library. These libraries provide functions for:
Generating frequent itemsets
Calculating support and confidence metrics
Identifying association rules
